contribute something to CoreUI Free Angular Admin Template? Here's how you can help.\nPlease take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.\nFollowing these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.\nUsing the issue tracker\nThe issue tracker is the preferred channel for bug reports, features requests and submitting pull requests, but please respect the following restrictions:\n\nPlease do not use the issue tracker for personal support requests.\n\nPlease do not post comments consisting solely of \"+1\" or \":thumbsup:\".\nUse GitHub's \"reactions\" feature\ninstead.\n\nPlease do not open issues or pull requests regarding the code in  @coreui/coreui and @coreui/coreui-angular (open them in their respective repositories).\n\n\nBug reports\nA bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository.\nGood bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!\nGuidelines for bug reports:\n\nValidate and lint your code — to ensure your problem isn't caused by a simple error in your own code.\n\nUse the GitHub issue search — check if the issue has already been reported.\n\nCheck if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the latest master or development branch in the repository.\n\nIsolate the problem — ideally create a reduced test case and a live example. This JS Bin is a helpful template.\n\n\nA good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more\ninformation. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is\nyour environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS\nexperience the problem? Do other browsers show the bug differently? What\nwould you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix\nany potential bugs.\nExample:\n\nShort and descriptive example bug report title\nA summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If\nsuitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.\n\nThis is the first step\nThis is the second step\nFurther steps, etc.\n\n - a link to the reduced test case\nAny other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being\nreported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as\ncausing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their\nmerits).\n\nFeature requests\nFeature requests are welcome. Before opening a feature request, please take a moment to find out whether your idea\nfits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong\ncase to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please\nprovide as much detail and context as possible.\nPull requests\nGood pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic\nhelp. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated\ncommits.\nPlease ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.\nimplementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),\notherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the\nproject's developers might not want to merge into the project.\nAdhering to the following process is the best way to get your work\nincluded in the project:\n\nFork the project, clone your fork,\nand configure the remotes:\n# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory\ngit clone https://github.com//free-angular-admin-template.git\n# Navigate to the newly cloned directory\ncd free-angular-admin-template\n# Assign the original repo to a remote called \"upstream\"\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-angular-admin-template.git\nIf you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:\ngit checkout master\ngit pull upstream master\nCreate a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to\ncontain your feature, change, or fix:\ngit checkout -b \nCommit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these git commit\nmessage guidelines\nor your code is unlikely to be merged into the main project. Use Git's\ninteractive rebase\nfeature to tidy up your commits before making them public.\n\nLocally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:\ngit pull [--rebase] upstream master\nPush your topic branch up to your fork:\ngit push origin \nOpen a Pull Request with a clear title and description against the master branch.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owners to license your work under the terms of the MIT License.\nSemantic Git commit messages\nInspired by Sparkbox's awesome article on semantic commit messages. Please use following commit message format.\n\nchore (updating npm tasks etc; no production code change) -> git test -m 'chore: commit-message-here'\ndocs (changes to documentation) -> git commit -m 'docs: commit-message-here'\nfeat (new feature) -> git commit -m 'feat: commit-message-here'\nfix (bug fix) -> git commit -m 'fix: commit-message-here'\nrefactor (refactoring production code) -> git commit -m 'refactor: commit-message-here'\nstyle (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change) -> git commit -m 'style: commit-message-here'\ntest (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change) -> git test -m 'refactor: commit-message-here'\n\nCode guidelines\nHTML\nAdhere to the Code Guide.\n\nUse tags and elements appropriate for an HTML5 doctype (e.g., self-closing tags).\nUse CDNs and HTTPS for third-party JS when possible. We don't use protocol-relative URLs in this case because they break when viewing the page locally via file://.\nUse WAI-ARIA attributes in documentation examples to promote accessibility.\n\nCSS\nAdhere to the Code Guide.\n\nWhen feasible, default color palettes should comply with WCAG color contrast guidelines.\nExcept in rare cases, don't remove default :focus styles (via e.g. outline: none;) without providing alternative styles. See this A11Y Project post for more details.\n\nJS\n\nNo semicolons (in client-side JS)\n2 spaces (no tabs)\nstrict mode\n\"Attractive\"\nDon't use jQuery event alias convenience methods (such as $().focus()). Instead, use $().trigger(eventType, ...) or $().on(eventType, ...), depending on whether you're firing an event or listening for an event. (For example, $().trigger('focus') or $().on('focus', function (event) { /* handle focus event */ })) We do this to be compatible with custom builds of jQuery where the event aliases module has been excluded.\n\nLicense\nBy contributing your code, you agree to license your contribution under the MIT License.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n
